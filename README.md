# LethalyGrey

This is a simple modpack that I have made to play with some friends.  
A modpack with a lot of QoL changes, balancing, and some added content.  

### Configuration

You can change your fov in game by typing '/fov \<value\>' into the chat.  
You can also toggle the helmet visor visual by typing '/toggleVisor', case matters for the V letter.  
Or, you can make these changes permanent by editing the 'BepInEx/config/Rozebud.FovAdjust.cfg' file instead.  

If you are using an ultrawide screen and want your HUD elements at the edges of your screen. In the 'BepInEx/config/LCUltrawide.cfg' file, change the AspectRatio setting back to 0.  

### QoL Changes

 - Keyboard and mouse rebinding
